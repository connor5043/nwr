		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
		
		      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
		      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
		      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

		   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
		
		   1. Definitions.
		
		      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
		      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
		
		      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
		      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
		
		      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
		      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
		      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
		      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
		      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
		      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
		      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
		
		      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
		      exercising permissions granted by this License.
		
		      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
		      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
		      source, and configuration files.
		
		      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
		      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
		      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
		      and conversions to other media types.
		
		      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
		      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
		      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
		      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
		
		      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
		      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
		
		      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
		      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
		      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
		      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
		      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
		      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
		      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
		      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
		      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
		      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
		      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
		      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
		      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
		
		      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
		      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
		      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
		
		   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
		      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
		      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
		
		   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
		      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
		      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
		      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
		      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		      as of the date such litigation is filed.
		
		   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		      meet the following conditions:
		
		      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
		          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
		
		      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
		          stating that You changed the files; and
		
		      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
		          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
		          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
		          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
		          the Derivative Works; and
		
		      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
		          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
		          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
		          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
		          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
		          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
		          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
		          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
		          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
		          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
		          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
		          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
		          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
		          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
		          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
		          as modifying the License.
		
		      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		      the conditions stated in this License.
		
		   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
		      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
		      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
		
		   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
		      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
		      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
		
		   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
		
		   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
		
		   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
		
		   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
		
		   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      
      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;CCPL&quot; OR &quot;LICENSE&quot;). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
   1. Definitions
      a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
      b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
      c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
      d. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
      e. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
      f. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
      g. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
      h. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
      i. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;
      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
      e. For the avoidance of doubt:
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor&#39;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&#39;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   7. Termination
      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
   8. Miscellaneous
      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.
      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

### LGPL-3.0-only

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http s ://fsf.org/&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
   0. Additional Definitions.
      
      As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
      
      &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      
      An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
      
      A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked Version&quot;.
      
      The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      
      The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   4. Combined Works.
   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
      d) Do one of the following:
         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   5. Combined Libraries.
   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

      2.1. Grants
      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

      2.2. Effective Date

      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#39;s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
      2.4. Subsequent Licenses
      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
      2.5. Representation
      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
      2.6. Fair Use
      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
      2.7. Conditions
      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
   3. Responsibilities
      3.1. Distribution of Source Form
      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form.
      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
      3.4. Notices
      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
      3.5. Application of Additional Terms
      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   5. Termination
      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
   6. Disclaimer of Warranty
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
   7. Limitation of Liability
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party&#39;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
   8. Litigation
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
   9. Miscellaneous
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
   10. Versions of the License
      10.1. New Versions
      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
      10.2. Effect of New Versions
      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
      10.3. Modified Versions
      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot; Notice
This Source Code Form is &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot;, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients&#39; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&#39;s ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

### OFL-1.1

Copyright (c) &lt;dates&gt;, &lt;Copyright Holder&gt; (&lt;URL|email&gt;),
with Reserved Font Name &lt;Reserved Font Name&gt;. This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS
&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).
&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.
&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:
   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.
   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.
   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.
TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.
DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
